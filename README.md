### <u>Purpose of Back-end:</u>

The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to **operate and that cannot be accessed by a user.** Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system. Typically the code is comprised of one or more programming languages. The back end is also called the data access layer of software or hardware and includes any functionality that needs to be accessed and navigated to by digital means.
